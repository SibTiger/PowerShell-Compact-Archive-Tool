2) What is PowerShell Compact-Archive Tool
--------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------


The PowerShell Compact-Archive Tool is a lightweight utility that allows any game designers to quickly
compile their (G)ZDoom-based projects into a single PK3 compressed file, streamlining the packaging process
and making it easier to distribute their hard work. This tool eliminates the need for game developers to
manually create and manage complex build scripts for their projects.

With just a few clicks from the Windows Start Menu to launch the tool, users can select their project,
compile the project's assets into a PK3 file, and share their creation with the world. This tool is designed
to be simple and efficient, making it ideal for both solo game designers and collaborative teams.

One of the key features of the PowerShell Compact-Archive Tool is its "One Install for Many Projects"
functionality. Meaning that once installed, this tool can compile any (G)ZDoom-based project, as long as the
project's resources adhere to the ZDoom PK3 filesystem structure. No additional installations or
modifications are required.

By reducing the setup time and eliminating the need for custom compilers, the PowerShell Compact-Archive Tool
empowers the game designers to focus on what matters most: creating really cool stuff and sharing their
creations and ideas to the world.
