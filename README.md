# PowerShell-Compact-Archive-Tool

The **PowerShell Compact-Archive Tool** is a lightweight utility that allows any game designers to quickly compile their [(G)ZDoom](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/ZDoom)-based projects into a single [**PK3**](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/PK3) compressed file, streamlining the packaging process and making it easier to distribute their hard work.  This tool eliminates the need for game developers to manually create and manage complex build scripts for their projects.

A key feature of the _PowerShell Compact-Archive Tool_ is its "**One Install for Many Projects**" functionality.  Meaning that once installed, this tool can compile any (G)ZDoom-based project, as long as the project's resources adhere to the ZDoom PK3 [filesystem structure](https://zdoom.org/wiki/Using_ZIPs_as_WAD_replacement#How_to).  No additional installations or modifications are required.

By reducing the setup time and eliminating the need for custom compilers, the _PowerShell Compact-Archive Tool_ empowers the game designers to focus on what matters most: creating really cool stuff and sharing their creations and ideas to the world.
