 # ==============================
 # This class will hold common Console User Interface instructions and procedures to
 #  reduce code duplication.  With the functions provided in this class, we can easily
 #  keep most of the User Interface content unified and consistent through out the
 #  entire program.  With the consistency of the UI, the end-user can easily navigate
 #  within the program with the outmost ease.  If we were not consistent, the user
 #  will easily get frustrated with the program.
