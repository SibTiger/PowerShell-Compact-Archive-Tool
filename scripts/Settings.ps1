 # ==============================
 # This class will allow the user to easily modify their settings
 #  from various known objects, in which contains variables that
 #  are configurable within the designated object - and friendly
 #  within the program's environment.  Because the idea of the
 #  program's objects are not supposed to integrate its settings
 #  per-class, we will need to use a centralized settings class
 #  to unify the User Interface and functionality, while allowing
 #  all of the objects to be configured respectively.  This is
 #  where this class comes into play.  We will want to be sure
 #  that we can easily allow the user to configure their settings
 #  and to make it as painless as possible.
