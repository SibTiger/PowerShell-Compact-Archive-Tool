<# Main Entry Point
 # ------------------------------
 # ==============================
 # ==============================
 # This source file will initialize the application's environment, assuring that the program can run within the host's
 #  PowerShell instance, provide a means for the user to interact within the software, and then - once the user had finished
 #  using the program - termination by safely closing the environment that had been created.
 #
 # Essentially, this is the spine of the entire program.  If the entry point fails, the entire application will fall apart.

#   assuring host compatibility, executing the Main Menu (User Interaction), and then self termination once the user
#   leaves the Main Menu.
