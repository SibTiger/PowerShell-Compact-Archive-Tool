 # ==============================
 # This class is the heart of the program - in which it allows the
 #  desired project to be compiled into a single archive data file.
 #  The builder will perform various steps to assure that the project
 #  is up to date with the remote repository, assure that all of the
 #  dependencies are ready for use, perform the compiling operation,
 #  verify the integrity of the newly generated archive datafile,
 #  and create any useful documentation as requested.  The user has
 #  full flexibility as to how the Builder operates and with what
 #  capabilities are usable.
