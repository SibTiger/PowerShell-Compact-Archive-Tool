<# Common GUI
 # ------------------------------
 # ==============================
 # ==============================
 # This class will hold various commonly used graphical user interfaces (GUI) that makes
 #  the interaction easier for the end-user.  With these functions defined within
 #  this object, we can easily keep the environment unified and consistent throughout
 #  the entire program.  Further, these functions will help to reduce code duplication
 #  as various other functions - outside from this class - can utilize these methods
 #  openly.  With the reduce of code duplication, we can spend more time on
 #  implementation of other functionalities and to easily maintain these member
 #  functions as necessary with minimal cost.
