<# Embed Installer - Projects
 # ------------------------------
 # ==============================
 # ==============================
 # This class provides the ability to install new projects into the program's environment.
 #  As time continues, new projects and improvements with existing will be made available,
 #  this class needs to meet with these needs.  Further, we need to allow a simple guided
 #  steps to perform these actions.  Due to the nature of the terminal - the user will be
 #  intimidated with the console window with limited-ease, compared to a standard GUI
 #  application.  With this fact, we need to be sure we automate the process in such a
 #  way that it is easy for the user - which they just want to get work done and deal with
 #  no fuss.
 #
 # DEVELOPER NOTES:
 #  We will rely heavily on the CommonGUI and CommonIO in order to make this
 #  functionality easy for the user.
