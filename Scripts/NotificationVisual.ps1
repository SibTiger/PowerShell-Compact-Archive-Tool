<# Notification Visual
 # ------------------------------
 # ==============================
 # ==============================
 # This class will provide the ability to notify the user based on certain specialized events.
 #  The notifications within this class provide visual alerts.  Visual alerts can quickly grab
 #  the user's attention, as it provides a graphical window within the foreground - which can
 #  easily catch the user's eyes.
 #
 # NOTE:
 #  For the visual notification in Windows 10, Burnt Toast will be used.  This provides fantastic
 #   functionality that can easily appeal to the user and the desired project.
